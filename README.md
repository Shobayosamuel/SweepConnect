# SweepConnect

### Team:
Shobayo Samuel - Fullstack developer

### Technologies:
Html, css, javascript, python and flask
### Challenge:
The Portfolio Project is intended to solve the problem of connecting people who need cleaning services with local cleaners. The project aims to provide a platform that makes it easy for users to find reliable and affordable cleaners in their area, without having to spend a lot of time searching for them.

### What the Portfolio Project will not solve:
The Portfolio Project will not solve the problem of cleaners not being available in certain areas or at certain times. Additionally, it will not address issues related to the quality of cleaning services provided by individual cleaners.

### Who the Portfolio Project will help and/or who the users will be:
The Portfolio Project will help people who are in need of cleaning services, such as busy professionals, elderly individuals, and individuals with disabilities. The project will also benefit local cleaners who are looking for more work and want to connect with potential clients in their area.

### Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale?
The project is not necessarily dependent on a specific locale, but it may be more relevant in certain areas where there is a higher demand for cleaning services or a higher concentration of cleaners. The project can be adapted to work in different locations by adjusting the search parameters and incorporating local payment systems.

## Risks:
### Technical risks:

- Server downtime or website crash: If the website experiences unexpected downtime or crashes, users will be unable to access the service. This could lead to a loss of trust and reputation damage.
Safeguard: Implementing robust hosting solutions and regular backups.

- Security breach: If there is a security breach, user data may be compromised, resulting in legal consequences and loss of trust.
Safeguard: Implementing SSL encryption, two-factor authentication, and regular security audits.

- Poor user experience: If the user interface is not intuitive and easy to use, users may abandon the service and seek alternative solutions.
Safeguard: Conducting user research and testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Non-technical risks:

- Liability issues: If a cleaner causes damage to a user's property or is injured while working, the company may face legal action.
Strategy: Implementing strict vetting procedures and insurance policies to minimize the risk of incidents.

- Negative reviews: If a significant number of users leave negative reviews about the service, it could harm the company's reputation and result in decreased demand.
- Strategy: Implementing a review system and addressing negative reviews promptly and professionally.

- Regulatory compliance: The company may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements related to employment, taxes, and insurance.
Strategy: Working with legal and financial advisors to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Infrastructure:

### Process for branching and merging:
Our team will be following the GitHub Trunk-based Development (No Branching): This is because I will be the only one working on the project.

### Strategy for deployment:
We will be using a cloud-based deployment platform such as Heroku or AWS to deploy our web app. Our deployment strategy will involve creating a staging environment for testing changes before deploying them to the production environment. We will also use continuous integration and deployment tools such as CircleCI to automate the deployment process and ensure that any changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production.

### Populating the app with data:
We will be using a combination of user-generated data and publicly available data to populate our app with data. Users will be able to create their profiles and submit requests for cleaners, while we will also be using APIs and scraping publicly available data to populate the app with information such as cleaner availability, pricing, and ratings.

### Tools, automation, or process for testing:
We will be using a combination of manual and automated testing to ensure the quality of our app. For manual testing, we will conduct usability testing, user acceptance testing, and exploratory testing to identify any issues with the user experience. For automated testing, we will use a combination of unit testing and integration testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, and Chai to test the individual components and their

## Existing Solutions:
- Handy: Handy is a popular on-demand home services platform that connects users with pre-screened independent professionals for cleaning, handyman, and other services. It charges users based on an hourly rate.

- TaskRabbit: TaskRabbit is another on-demand services platform that connects users with local service providers. It charges users based on an hourly rate, and cleaning services are among the services offered.

- Tidy: Tidy is a platform that connects users with local cleaning professionals for one-time or recurring cleaning services. It charges users based on an hourly rate, and users can book services online.

## Similarities and Differences:
All of these solutions are on-demand home services platforms that allow users to request cleaning services from local professionals. They all charge users based on an hourly rate and provide a convenient online booking process. However, there may be differences in the types of cleaners available, pricing, and features offered.

#### In this case, we do not intend to reimplement an existing solution but instead plan to create our own web app to provide a similar service. Our decision to create our own app is based on the need to provide a more personalized and user-friendly experience, as well as the potential to offer unique features and pricing options. We have studied existing solutions to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and will use this information to create an app that addresses these issues and provides a better user experience.
